allocation:
- further increase reliability of the system by 
  using a custom allocator with a preallocated buffer of ~128mb
  instead of Global since max memory footprint is known at compile time.

serial_interface:
- shared solution for devices controlled directly via usb or a serial interface like the wago 750-653 

server/src/main.rs:
- tight coupling with LaserMachine inside handle_serial_device_hotplug

machines/src/serial/registry.rs:
- new_serial_device is unused. What is it's purpose?
- each device is directly coupled to a machine (). Should be modular



- common interface
